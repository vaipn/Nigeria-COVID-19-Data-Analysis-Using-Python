## Project Overview
Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is an infectious disease caused by a newly discovered coronavirus, and it has affected major parts of the world. Nigeria, a West-African country, has also been affected by the COVID-19 pandemic after recording its first case on 27th February 2020.

Nigeria is a country with 37 states - Federal Capital Territory included- and a fast-growing economic environment with about 200 million citizens. COVID-19 has affected several country activities as the country steadily progressed from its first case to shutting down major airports, state-wide lockdown, curfews, and reviving its economy.

In this project, data science & analysis skills is used to collect data, explore the data, perform analysis, create visualizations, and generate insights.

This project is organized as follows :
- Data Collection
- Data Cleaning and Preparation
- Data Analysis
- Executive Summary

Datasets used: Budget data.csv, RealGDP.csv, covid_external.csv, [NCDC metrics on COVID-19 across the 37 states (FCT included)](https://covid19.ncdc.gov.ng/), [COVID-19 Data Repository by the Center for Systems Science and Engineering (CSSE) at Johns Hopkins University](https://github.com/CSSEGISandData/COVID-19/blob/master/csse_covid_19_data/csse_covid_19_time_series/time_series_covid19_confirmed_global.csv)
