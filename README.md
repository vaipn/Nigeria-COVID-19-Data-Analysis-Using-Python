## Project Overview
Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is an infectious disease caused by a newly discovered coronavirus, and it has affected major parts of the world. Nigeria, a West-African country, has also been affected by the COVID-19 pandemic after recording its first case on 27th February 2020.

Nigeria is a country with 37 states - Federal Capital Territory included- and a fast-growing economic environment with about 200 million citizens. COVID-19 has affected several country activities as the country steadily progressed from its first case to shutting down major airports, state-wide lockdown, curfews, and reviving its economy.

Data science and analysis skills play important roles in providing insights from the Nigerian COVID-19 metrics such as the: 
*	Rank of states in terms of Total confirmed cases, Total recovered cases, Total death cases.
*	The percentage of the confirmed cases that died as a result of the disease in each state
*	Periods where the highest infection rate were recorded, maximum daily infection rate (plus the date it was recorded).
*	Evaluation of alarming factors that could enhance the impact of the pandemic in each state. To help guide the resource allocation of governments, donors, organizations, and companies, Empower media, advocacy groups, and citizens with information, and to enable more targeted, sector-specific interventions to mitigate the impact of the pandemic in these states. 
*	Identification of the most vulnerable states and the states that would need external support the most.
*	Determination of the primary cause for high number of cases.
*	And finally the effect of the pandemic on the GDP.


This project aims to use data science & analytic skills to collect data, explore the data, perform analysis, create visualizations, and generate insights.

Steps/Approaches:
- Data Collection
- Data Cleaning and Preparation
- Data Analysis

Suggestions on future work/Improvement plans: 
- Using Travel and Tourism metrics of the states in addition to the datasets used, to perform more analysis.

Datasets used: Budget data.csv, RealGDP.csv, covid_external.csv, [NCDC metrics on COVID-19 across the 37 states (FCT included)](https://covid19.ncdc.gov.ng/), [COVID-19 Data Repository by the Center for Systems Science and Engineering (CSSE) at Johns Hopkins University](https://github.com/CSSEGISandData/COVID-19/blob/master/csse_covid_19_data/csse_covid_19_time_series/time_series_covid19_confirmed_global.csv)
